## 🌼 A Bit About Me

I’m a second-year CSE (AI) student with a heart for design and a mind for systems.  
My journey into tech introduced me to the beauty of **problem-solving**, but design taught me how to do it with **empathy**.

I’m deeply passionate about **user-centered design**, accessibility, and turning complex ideas into clear, intuitive interfaces.  
To me, good design isn’t just how something looks — it’s how it feels, flows, and functions.
